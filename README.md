# ðŸ¦Ž Chameleo: An Adaptive Recommendation System for Video-on-Demand (VOD) Platforms


## Introduction

In the era of unprecedented digital content growth, particularly in Video-on-Demand (VOD) platforms, users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices. Effective recommendation systems are paramount for enhancing user experience, improving content discoverability, and boosting engagement. **Chameleo** is an innovative, adaptive recommendation system designed to address the challenges inherent in large-scale VOD environments, leveraging advanced graph-based methodologies and social network analysis.

## Problem Statement

The rapid expansion of digital content leads to critical issues in recommendation systems, primarily:
1.  **Data Sparsity:** Many users interact with only a tiny fraction of available content, leading to incomplete interaction data.
2.  **Cold Start Problem:** New users or new content lack sufficient interaction data for traditional collaborative filtering methods to provide accurate recommendations.

These challenges result in suboptimal recommendations, decreased user engagement, and missed opportunities for content discovery.

## Solution: Chameleo's Approach

Chameleo proposes a novel, scalable, and structured framework that utilizes an ego-centric perspective on social networks to provide highly relevant and dynamic recommendations. Our system constructs and analyzes intricate graph structures derived from user-item interactions and video similarities, employing sophisticated centrality measures and community detection algorithms.

## Key Features

* **Graph-Based Modeling:**
    * **User-Item Interaction Graph:** Models connections between users and the content they consume.
    * **Video Similarity Graph:** Captures relationships between videos based on their features or user co-viewing patterns.
* **Advanced Centrality Measures:** Integrates various centrality metrics (e.g., Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Eigenvector, PageRank) to identify influential users and content within the network.
* **Modularity-Based Clustering:** Employs the **Leiden algorithm** for robust and efficient community detection, enabling the identification of cohesive user groups or content clusters.
* **Ego-Focused Centrality Index (CEF):** A custom index designed to quantify the importance of an entity (user or video) from an ego-centric viewpoint within its local network.
* **Ego-Centric Recommendation Score (RSEF):** A unique scoring mechanism that leverages the CEF to generate personalized and contextually relevant recommendations.
* **Adaptive Recommendation Logic:** The system dynamically adjusts recommendations based on evolving user behavior and content trends.

## Architecture Overview

Chameleo's architecture is centered around robust graph databases and analytical components. It involves:
1.  **Data Ingestion:** Processing VOD viewing logs and metadata.
2.  **Graph Construction:** Building dynamic user-item and video similarity graphs.
3.  **Graph Analysis Module:** Applying centrality measures and the Leiden algorithm.
4.  **Recommendation Engine:** Calculating CEF and RSEF scores to generate recommendations.
5.  **API/Integration Layer:** For seamless integration with VOD platforms.

## Data

Chameleo is designed to work with large-scale VOD platform data, specifically:
* User viewing history (e.g., `user_id`, `video_id`, `viewing_percentage`, `timestamp`)
* Video metadata (e.g., `video_id`, `genres`, `actors`, `director`, `description`)

## Results and Impact

Chameleo has been shown to effectively mitigate the challenges associated with data sparsity and the cold start problem in VOD recommendation systems. By providing highly relevant and adaptive content suggestions, the platform significantly enhances user engagement and content discovery, leading to a more satisfying and personalized viewing experience. Its scalable and structured framework ensures efficient performance even with ever-growing datasets.
